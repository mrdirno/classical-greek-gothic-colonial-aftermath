## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a chapter from the perspective of Silas, detailing the strange occurrences he witnessed in the years before the Lykos family arrived, framed as entries in his factor's ledger.
- Create a folk tale told by the Weng'lit people about 'P'tukquak' (the place where the rock listens), explaining the origin of the stain/ward in the foundation.
- Draft the lost letters from the deceased cousin who originally purchased the land, revealing what he truly knew or suspected about the headland.
- Write a scene where Eleni attempts to translate the geometric stain using her classical knowledge, accidentally activating a fragment of its memory.

### Technical Entry Points

- Build a 'Memory Map' of the headland: an interactive website that layers the Greek family's perceptions, the Weng'lit stories, and the geological/archaeological reality of the site.
- Create a generative art piece that uses the described geometric 'ward' pattern as a seed algorithm, visually representing the growth of memory and hauntings described in the novel.
