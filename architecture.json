  "cover_prompt": "A fallen Greek patriarch stands rigid, his hand pressed against the cold, veined marble of a newly laid foundation block, from which spectral, ancient hands of indigenous stone emerge to grasp his wrist in a silent, arresting warning. The scene is set at dusk on a raw coastal construction site, where the skeletal beams of a neo-classical mansion clash against the enduring, monolithic ruins of a much older temple; scattered tools, modern blueprints lifted by the wind, and weathered ancestral portraits leaning against crates speak of displacement and arrogant imposition. In the atmospheric style of a classical gothic painting by Ivan Aivazovsky merged with the haunting, textured realism of Anselm Kiefer, capturing both maritime gloom and the weight of history in material. Book cover framing, centered and monumental composition viewed from a low, dramatic angle looking up at the conflicted man against the stormy sky. Chiaroscuro lighting with a stark contrast between the warm, dying light of a colonial lantern and the cold, ethereal bioluminescence emanating from the ancient stones, using a palette of deep granite grays, Aegean sea greens, tarnished gold, and ghostly cyan. masterpiece, best quality, ultra detailed, intricate details, professional composition, sharp focus, 8k resolution, flux dev."
